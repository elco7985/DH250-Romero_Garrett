# Users In Context
## Introduction
Based off the initial findings of the Mathisfun.com [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2001) and [pilot usability test](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2002), the research has reached its next phase of data collection. The research that takes place is based on participant observation and contextual inquiry user experience methodology that is focused at collecting qualitative data towards facilitating effective math learning lessons to students in and outside of classroom learning. Specifically, the research observes and explores the tools, strategies, and pain points of teaching math to a group of elementary school children by a female, middle-aged teacher based in Los Angeles, California. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Mathisfun.com website.  

## Design Challenge
Given the preliminary data findings based off the pilot usability test on the Mathisfun.com website (usability performance issues, antiquated learning lessons and modules, complimentary features to facilitate learning), the goal was to understand what attracts a student’s attention in a learning environment, especially when it comes to supplemental learning, to ultimately enhance a female teacher's learning toolkit who is middle-aged. This is directly relevant to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, Self-actualization, where “achieving one’s full potential, including activities” is the primary concern. While the current solution towards providing supplemental learning is through open-source (or free) web platforms, these digital places of learning are limiting based off of antiquated design elements, outdated content, and the limitations of using creative learning exercises. It is with these limitations in mind where potential design solutions will be identified through the research.   

## Target Users
The characteristics of the primary user is a middle-aged (between 40-60 years of age) female teacher, who is highly educated and has significant amounts of teaching experience. This particular teacher is currently engaged in remote learning activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More importantly, this specific user is relying more heavily on digital learning tools to help facilitate math lessons both inside and outside of the remote learning classroom. While typical lesson plans are facilitated in a classroom area, where a teacher can utilize a smartboard to enhance learning instruction, the home environment is also an area of focus considering that teaching remotely can be flexible due to the robustness of a personal laptop device and accessories. Through this flexibility, this particular teacher engages in live teaching through a video conference platform to teach math by providing and going over examples of math problems, assigning additional math problems based off the required math textbook, and assign homework activities using the math textbook and/or supplemental websites. 

## Research Methods
### Participant Observation
Participant observation will be utilized within this study and will take place in the home environment of a teacher facilitating math instruction remotely, who meets the demographics of the targeted user group. The participant observation serves two primary purposes: First, it is to engage with the targeted user group in a way that puts the researcher in the “users’ shoes”; Lastly, it will help generate questions to help moderate the contextual inquiry. This specific method will allow the researcher to see the user in a live teaching environment and gain a deeper understanding of tasks involved in teaching math, the current technology being utilized to facilitate learning, reveal the pain points experienced while facilitating learning, and any other relevant data that might beneficial to the overall study. More importantly, the initial data collected from the participant observation will be used to help craft strategic interview questions for the semi-structured contextual inquiry. 

### Semi-Structured Contextual Inquiry
The semi-structured contextual inquiry will be based on a flexible style of interviewing the participant. The questions that are generated from the participant observation will be incorporated into the inquiry to provide a tailored approach into understanding the user’s needs, wants and concerns related to teaching math. Many of the questions will be crafted as open-ended question but will also leave room for questions to confirm assumptions from the participant observation. More importantly, many interviewing techniques will be utilized with the inquiry, such as laddering, which allows the researcher to understand the users world more deeply when it comes to teaching math, and “going down the rabbit hole,” which will allow the researcher to explore certain topics and concepts being raised by the participant.
