# Users In Context
## Introduction
Based off the initial findings of the Mathisfun.com [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2001) and [pilot usability test](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2002), the research has reached its next phase of data collection. The research that takes place is based on participant observation and contextual inquiry user experience methodology that is focused at collecting qualitative data towards facilitating effective math learning lessons to students in and outside of classroom learning. Specifically, the research observes and explores the tools, strategies, and pain points of teaching math to a group of elementary school children by a female, middle-aged teacher based in Los Angeles, California. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Mathisfun.com website.  

## Design Challenge
Given the preliminary data findings based off the pilot usability test on the Mathisfun.com website (usability performance issues, antiquated learning lessons and modules, complimentary features to facilitate learning), the goal was to understand what attracts a student’s attention in a learning environment, especially when it comes to supplemental learning, to ultimately enhance a female teacher's learning toolkit who is middle-aged. This is directly relevant to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, Self-actualization, where “achieving one’s full potential, including activities” is the primary concern. While the current solution towards providing supplemental learning is through open-source (or free) web platforms, these digital places of learning are limiting based off of antiquated design elements, outdated content, and the limitations of using creative learning exercises. It is with these limitations in mind where potential design solutions will be identified through the research.   

## Target Users
The characteristics of the primary user is a middle-aged (between 40-60 years of age) female teacher, who is highly educated and has significant amounts of teaching experience. This particular teacher is currently engaged in remote learning activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. More importantly, this specific user is relying more heavily on digital learning tools to help facilitate math lessons both inside and outside of the remote learning classroom. While typical lesson plans are facilitated in a classroom area, where a teacher can utilize a smartboard to enhance learning instruction, the home environment is also an area of focus considering that teaching remotely can be flexible due to the robustness of a personal laptop device and accessories. Through this flexibilityo fbeing able to teach remotely, this particular teacher engages in live teaching through a video conference platform to teach math by providing and going over examples of math problems, assigning additional math problems based off the required math textbook, and assign homework activities using the math textbook and/or supplemental math websites. 

## Research Methods
### Participant Observation
Participant observation will be utilized within this study and will take place in the home environment of a teacher facilitating math instruction remotely, who meets the demographics of the targeted user group. The participant observation serves two primary purposes: First, it is to engage with the targeted user group in a way that puts the researcher in the “users’ shoes”; Lastly, it will help generate questions to help moderate the contextual inquiry. This specific method will allow the researcher to see the user in a live teaching environment and gain a deeper understanding of tasks involved in teaching math, the current technology being utilized to facilitate learning, reveal the pain points experienced while facilitating learning, and any other relevant data that might beneficial to the overall study. More importantly, the initial data collected from the participant observation will be used to help craft strategic interview questions for the semi-structured contextual inquiry. 

### Semi-Structured Contextual Inquiry
The semi-structured contextual inquiry will be based on a flexible style of interviewing the participant. The questions that are generated from the participant observation will be incorporated into the inquiry to provide a tailored approach into understanding the user’s needs, wants and concerns related to teaching math. Many of the questions will be crafted as open-ended question but will also leave room for questions to confirm assumptions from the participant observation. More importantly, many interviewing techniques will be utilized with the inquiry, such as laddering, which allows the researcher to understand the users world more deeply when it comes to teaching math, and “going down the rabbit hole,” which will allow the researcher to explore certain topics and concepts being raised by the participant.

## Context & Observation/Interview Guide
The researcher will begin the study process by introducing himself to the participant and explain the purpose of the research study. After explaining and answering questions related to the study, the researcher will go over the format of the contextual inquiry and what to expect along the way of the study. More importantly, the researcher will request permission to: 

* Conduct the study with the participant
* Record the observation and interview
* Take field notes during both phases
* Disseminate the research data for purely academic purposes

If the research does receive consent to perform everything listed above, then the researcher will move on to the next phase of informing the participant. Specifically, the researcher will notify the participant:

* They can choose to take a break and pause the study at any point in time, 
* They can stop the study at any time with no explanation needed*They can request the retraction or modification of any response given during and after the interview
* They may request the permanent deletion of data that was taken during the study

As mentioned previously, questions will be identified and crafted from the participant observation to facilitate the semi-structured contextual inquiry interview process. To generate the questions for the contextual inquiry, certain themes and concepts related to the Mathisfun.com heuristic evaluation and pilot usability test findings will be extracted before the study and written down on the fieldnotes. This will ultimately help the researcher reference back to the findings through the participant observation process to help generate key questions that would be relevant to the contextual inquiry interview. 

## Reflections
It was interesting to conduct a loosely structured interview for the contextual inquiry. The participant observation allowed me to collect data and key insights instantaneously that I was unable to capture through past research methodologies. Moreover, I was able to use the data to craft my questions in a tailored manner for the interview process that helped lead to some insightful findings. In one sense, engaging with the participant observation helped me experience some of the true essence of implementing qualitative research and allowed me to think more creatively about the questions I wanted to ask. More importantly, it did not restrict me to a certain thought process, which I also found beneficial. Alternatively, I still think a structured script is just as important since it does allow you to target certain aspects of the study you do not want to forget while interviewing a participant.

Another thing to highlight is some of the sub-conscious biases I entered with into the study. Specifically, the participant used for the participant observation and contextual inquiry was my aunt, whom I am extremely close to. When you have that type of connection to the person, I did not take into account the assumptions of knowing this person really well. While this level of bias could have backfired, it ended up serving me well in my observations. I was able to observe my aunt in a different context than I am normally used to viewing her. To be quite honest, I learned a lot from her teaching style in just the short 30 minutes of observation. However, I need to be more conscious about my biases when implementing future qualitative UX research studies. 

Lastly, do not turn off the camera until you are at your car and finished with the interview process. I learned this lesson the hard way when I was speaking with my Aunt after I thought I had wrapped up the interview. During this part of the conversation, she shared a cool feature idea of how teaching math in a live manner would be beneficial for supplemental learning. While I did not capture this moment on camera, I did manage to write down this idea in my fieldnotes. However, it was a good mistake to make and a valuable lesson learned.
