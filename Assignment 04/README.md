# Users In Context
## Introduction
Based off the initial findings of the Mathisfun.com heuristic evaluation and pilot usability test, the research has reached its next phase of data collection. The research that takes place is based on participant observation and contextual inquiry user experience methodology that is focused at collecting qualitative data towards facilitating effective math learning lessons to students in and outside of classroom learning. Specifically, the research observes and explores the tools, strategies, and pain points of teaching math to a group of elementary school children by a female, middle-aged teacher based in Los Angeles, California. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Mathisfun.com website.  

## Design Challenge
Given the preliminary data findings based off the pilot usability test on the Mathisfun.com website (usability performance issues, antiquated learning lessons and modules, complimentary features to facilitate learning), the goal was to understand what attracts a student’s attention in a learning environment, especially when it comes to supplemental learning, to ultimately enhance a female teacher's learning toolkit who is middle-aged. This is directly relevant to Maslow’s hierarchy of need, Self-actualization, where “achieving one’s full potential, including activities” is the primary concern. While the current solution towards providing supplemental learning is through open-source (or free) web platforms, these digital places of learning are limiting based off of design, outdated content, and the limitation of creative learning exercises. It is with these limitations in mind where potential design solutions will be identified through the research.
