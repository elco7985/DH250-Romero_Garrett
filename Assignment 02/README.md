## Reflections
The study in many ways accomplished what the research goal was - to confirm and find pain points throughout the website
Great feedback - thought the site was antiquated. Affirmed my suspicions about user control and freedom, graphics placement, recognition vs. recall, navigating the website being cumbersome and more. 
I wasn't planning on the user stumbling onto user control and freedom issues with certain question, however the I did state that this particular violation was rampant throughout the website. 
In executing the research, I should habe been more mindful about the research setting. Specifically, conducting the research on two different screens while using Zoom. ONe part of the scenario was supposed to engage with the horizantal navigation arrows and due to the redcuion of the website space on the screen, that particular functionality was not displayed and the user was not able to visually see it or engage with it. This serves as a great mistake to always be thorough in your test environment for research before implementing it
