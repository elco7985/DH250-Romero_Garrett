## Reflections
The study in many ways accomplished what the research goal was - to confirm and find pain points throughout the website
Great feedback - thought the site was antiquated. Affirmed my suspicions about user control and freedom, graphics placement, recognition vs. recall, navigating the website being cumbersome and more. This exercise really reinforced how beneficial it is to conduct a heuristic evaluation first, in order to craft and implement the usability test. Very insightful and felt like I was not guessing certain assumptions. 
I wasn't planning on the user stumbling onto user control and freedom issues with a certain question, however the I did state that this particular violation was rampant throughout the website. 
In executing the research, I should habe been more mindful about the research setting. Specifically, conducting the research on two different screens while using Zoom. ONe part of the scenario was supposed to engage with the horizantal navigation arrows and due to the redcuion of the website space on the screen, that particular functionality was not displayed and the user was not able to visually see it or engage with it. This serves as a great mistake to always be thorough in your test environment for research before implementing it. Crafting the scenarios was also challenging. I had to put myself in the shoes of a teacher to make sure the scenarios made sense. I ran the scenarios by my aunt, who recommended and uses the site, to make sure they made sense and were not out of scope. Lastly, my target audience is teachers who are middle-aged women so my initial research subject met that criteria. However, my research subject dropped out of the study due to personal reasons and I had to act quickly to get a research particpant. While the participant was middle-aged, he was male and not a teacher. For future research, I know that I need to target that audience. Lastly, I was able to utilize some elements of user interviews into the usability test. Specifically, I asked impromptu questions where I felt were needed to be asked, I engaged in open-ended questions, utilized laddering techniques, and allowed the user to fully explain himself and never cut him off at any point. One thing I would like to add into the usability test is a different set of card selection where it touches on emotion. I had asked a question about emotion during the test and I felt like guaging the set of emotions the user went through would be another level insight that is important to the study. 
## dated and uninviting. Would only visit once. How contemporary is this going be towards modern learning when everything just looks like it is from 1993. It looks like one of the original websites. And if you're trying to tell me math is fun, there is not a single fun thing navigating your site. If this is exactly why kids hate math, it is just so stiff and there is no dimension, no depth.
