## Math is fun Moderated Usability Test 
----
### Introduction
In today's COVID-19 reality, remote learning has become required and additional educational resources are becoming even more important to facilitate effective this new reality. The Math is fun website is an educational resource for mathematics supplemental learning. It provides math examples, simple how-to videos, math worksheets and quizzes and more. My initial impressions is that I found the website fairly straighforward and did not overwhelm me with information based on the landing page. However, after conducting the heuristic evaluation, based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles, I found a few violations that potentially impacted usability of the website. Specifically:

* **User Control & Freedom:** Mathisfun does provide user control and freedom, however, it is not consistent. Upon selecting the various categories displayed (algebra, geometry, etc.) on the header bar, a user does have directional functions to move forward or backwards with the content associated to it. What becomes conflictual is that there is too much user control and freedom while simultaneously lacking it.
* **Match between system and the real world:** The child pages linking to the header bar tend to deviate from this aspect. The design logos are not placed in a uniform manner, which may have the user engage visually with the content in a left-to-right or right-to-left manner.
* **Recognition rather than recall:** The area where Mathisfun does rely on recall versus recognition is when the navigational arrows to switch between content pages become non-existent. Once the arrows are removed, then the user needs to remember how to get back to previous content that was explored.
* **Consistency and standards:** The consistency issue that should be addressed is with the horizontal direction arrows that was discussed in the ‘User control and freedom’ section.

### Purpose for Usability Testing
The purpose of the usability test for the Mathisfun website is to confirm whether or not the violations I identified from the heuristic evaluation are valid. Through moderating a usability test with a potential user, it will give me actionable insight and allow me to ask questions along the way that will gain further understanding to the issues that might be present on the website. More importantly, the usability test is structured around three scenarios to identify the pain points based on ease of use, efficiency, and information seeking behavior. These specific scenarios are relateable to the heuristic violations identified and will allow me to recommend actionable steps to improve the usability of the Mathisfun website to relevant stakeholders.

### Methodology
To perform the Mathisfun usability test, recuitment will be focused on identifying a woman who fits the demographics identified from the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/blob/main/README.md). To perform most of the tasks of the usability test, A google form was created to present the script of the usability test, inform the participant of the nature of the research, guarantee participant safety, to perform the usability test and capture the data. The usability test will be conducted on the Zoom video confernce software. This is meant to protect particpant(s) due to social distancing recommendations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Upon meeting with the research participant on Zoom, the moderator will inform the participant of

## Reflections
The study in many ways accomplished what the research goal was - to confirm and find pain points throughout the website
Great feedback - thought the site was antiquated. Affirmed my suspicions about user control and freedom, graphics placement, recognition vs. recall, navigating the website being cumbersome and more. This exercise really reinforced how beneficial it is to conduct a heuristic evaluation first, in order to craft and implement the usability test. Very insightful and felt like I was not guessing certain assumptions. 
I wasn't planning on the user stumbling onto user control and freedom issues with a certain question, however the I did state that this particular violation was rampant throughout the website. 
In executing the research, I should habe been more mindful about the research setting. Specifically, conducting the research on two different screens while using Zoom. ONe part of the scenario was supposed to engage with the horizantal navigation arrows and due to the redcuion of the website space on the screen, that particular functionality was not displayed and the user was not able to visually see it or engage with it. This serves as a great mistake to always be thorough in your test environment for research before implementing it. Crafting the scenarios was also challenging. I had to put myself in the shoes of a teacher to make sure the scenarios made sense. I ran the scenarios by my aunt, who recommended and uses the site, to make sure they made sense and were not out of scope. Lastly, my target audience is teachers who are middle-aged women so my initial research subject met that criteria. However, my research subject dropped out of the study due to personal reasons and I had to act quickly to get a research particpant. While the participant was middle-aged, he was male and not a teacher. For future research, I know that I need to target that audience. Lastly, I was able to utilize some elements of user interviews into the usability test. Specifically, I asked impromptu questions where I felt were needed to be asked, I engaged in open-ended questions, utilized laddering techniques, and allowed the user to fully explain himself and never cut him off at any point. One thing I would like to add into the usability test is a different set of card selection where it touches on emotion. I had asked a question about emotion during the test and I felt like guaging the set of emotions the user went through would be another level insight that is important to the study. 

## lacked homebutton on pages which identified another violation

## dated and uninviting. Would only visit once. How contemporary is this going be towards modern learning when everything just looks like it is from 1993. It looks like one of the original websites. And if you're trying to tell me math is fun, there is not a single fun thing navigating your site. If this is exactly why kids hate math, it is just so stiff and there is no dimension, no depth.
