# Websites Focused in Providing Academic Resources for Teachers Who Are Middle-aged Women
## Garrett Romero - Digital Humanities 250
### Description: In the age of COVID-19, remote teaching has become mandatory for the educational world. Teachers are forced to utilize various technologies in order to facilitate and execute their lesson plans on a daily basis. The scope of this project focuses on how middle-age women, who are teachers in elementary school, engage with websites that provide supplemental academic resources for their lessons. The goal of this project is to help identify usability improvements for two website competitors that provide academic resources, which midddle-aged women who are teachers utilize on regular basis. In order to achieve the projects goal, a  heuristic evaluation will be conducted to understand what works well and what are the pain points to create better remote learning experiences.

### Mathantics Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic Principle      | Severity Ranking | Comments     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :----         |
| Visibility of system status      | 1 | The status of system is adequately conveyed on the website. When hovering over buttons with embedded hyperlinks on the website, they either change color or the cursor changes from pointer to a hand with index finger sticking out. Moreover, when engaging with the video content, it provides play/stop options and a status bar to signify whether or not the video is playing and where it is specifically on the timeline. While the system conveys status to the user, it can be hard to differentiate due to some buttons on the website not being clearly designed as buttons. A user needs to drag their cursor over some buttons in order to get a proper status conveyed. |
| Match between system and the real world   | 2        | The landing page is complex and confusing. Specifically, there many things going on with the landing page that tend stray away from real world expectations of navigating websites. Notifications and button options are out of place and hard to follow. Specifically, notifications and button options are placed all over the landing page creating a zig-zagging effect. Moreover, the landing page leads directly to the video content. While this makes sense, it provides an overwhelming display of information and content. In comparison to traditional websites, where it’s welcoming and allows the user to naturally engage with main header options, this site crams everything all onto the landing page.  |
| User control and freedom      | 0 | Mathantics sufficiently provides user control and freedom. The Mathantics logo button is clearly displayed and visually defined as the home button. Additionally, as a user engaged with video content, there is ‘Previous’ and ‘Next’ option that allows the person to backtrack to previous and upcoming content. Moreover, the subscription section of the page allows you to ‘cancel’ in case you did not want to commit to a subscription.  |
| Consistency and standards   | 3 |  Mathantics internal consistency needs major improvement. The various buttons and options highlight to different colors which tends to display a lack of standardization. While it is relevant for all the buttons, the greatest lack of consistency occurs with the hyperlinks. The ones directly associated to the landing page do not indicate any color change while the ones located at the bottom do indicate change to a different color when hovering the cursor over the hyperlink. More broadly, the website branding, especially when it comes to background colors, is not uniform as well. The landing page and the main child pages associated to the header bar options have different color themes (blue, green, and light pale blue) in comparison to the video content pages (blue and light pale blue). |

### Website Name: Math is fun

### Overall Evaluation:
Change graphic icons to change a different color (maybe shaded backgrounded). 
### Mathantics Heuristic Evaluation
| Heuristic Principle      | Severity Ranking | Comments     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :----         |
| Visibility of system status      | 1 | System status is very well conveyed on this site. Buttons are clearly defined and change different colors when hovering over them. When engaging with the search bar, it will immediately use predictive searching and begin populating the page with results as you go along. In my opinion, this conveying to the user in real time of the search function performing the user query. Moreover, when a user is performing math equation problems on the website, it will automatically signal whether the user got it right or wrong. Where status is not clearly conveyed is through the graphic icons on the worksheet page not changing color. The cursor only changes to a hand with index finger to signify system status.  |
| Match between system and the real world   | 1  | The Mathisfun website landing page does a good job of matching system to real world expectations. However, the child pages linking to the header bar tend to deviate from this aspect. The design logos are not placed in a uniform manner, which may have the user engage visually with the content in a left-to-right or right-to-left manner.         |
| User control and freedom      | 3 | Mathisfun does provide user control and freedom, however, it is not consistent. Upon selecting the various categories displayed (algebra, geometry, etc.) on the header bar, a user does have directional functions to move forward or backwards with the content associated to it. A great example of this the Algebra section. However, what becomes conflictual is that there is too much user control and freedom while simultaneously lacking it. Where there becomes too much user control and freedom is that there are two sets of directional arrows, which can confuse the user of where to navigate. Alternatively, once you’ve reached the final content page for the Algebra section, the directional arrows are non-existent and force the user to start over.  |
