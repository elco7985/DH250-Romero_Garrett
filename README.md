# Websites Focused in Providing Academic Resources for Teachers Who Are Middle-aged Women
## Garrett Romero - Digital Humanities 250
### Description: In the age of COVID-19, remote teaching has become mandatory for the educational world. Teachers are forced to utilize various technologies in order to facilitate and execute their lesson plans on a daily basis. The scope of this project focuses on how middle-age women, who are teachers in elementary school, engage with websites that provide supplemental academic resources for their lessons. The goal of this project is to help identify usability improvements for two website competitors that provide academic resources, which midddle-aged women who are teachers utilize on regular basis. In order to achieve the projects goal, a  heuristic evaluation will be conducted to understand what works well and what are the pain points to create better remote learning experiences.

| Heuristic Principle      | Severity Ranking | Comments     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :----         |
| Visibility of system status      | 1       | The status of system is adequately conveyed on the website. When hovering over buttons with embedded hyperlinks on the website, they either change color or the cursor changes from pointer to a hand with index finger sticking out. Moreover, when engaging with the video content, it provides play/stop options and a status bar to signify whether or not the video is playing and where it is specifically on the timeline. While the system conveys status to the user, it can be hard to differentiate due to some buttons on the website not being clearly designed as buttons. A user needs to drag their cursor over some buttons in order to get a proper status conveyed. |
