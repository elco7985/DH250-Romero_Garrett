# Low Fidelity Prototype

## Introduction
To provide a brief recap, the goal of the design project is to identify frustrations, pain points, and potential usability opportunities for users who are middle-aged women. The selected website, Mathisfun.com, was chosen to target middle-aged women who were teachers and a series of methodologies was implemented to gather actionable qualitative data. Based on the data collected throughout the entire research, the next phase is to create a low-fidelity wireframe and prototype to present and test out with pilot users. The purpose of the low-fidelity wireframes is to see the system functionality and usability on the potential features being incorporated into the design. The following features were recommended based off the [User Personas and Customer Journey Maps](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2005):

* Update the header bar for user efficiency
* Implement a simple redesign, including a welcome page and background graphics
* Customization feature to tailor math worksheets
* Copy URL function to send customized/non-customized worksheets to other users
* A ‘Math Toolkit’ shortcut feature that leads a user to a help page
* A navigation button to easily go back to math worksheet
* A conceptual baseball game that incorporates group activity features and includes a Copy URL function

In order to see the viability of the proposed wireframe, a pilot tester was recruited to perform three different tasks based on the proposed features in the wireframe. The pilot test is meant to assess the design of the features and to provide user feedback for later design iterations. A simple script was drafted, highlighting the goals of the research and instructions of how to conduct the usability test.

## Tasks

### 1). Customize math worksheet as a teacher
You’re a teacher that needs to prepare an online homework assignment for your students. Select the Getting Tougher Multiplication worksheet. Customize the math questions to meet your students skill level. Finish and copy the Worksheet URL to send to your students.


### 2). Create a customizable game as a teacher
You’re a teacher that wants to use an interactive game to help your students learn math as a group activity. Select the Baseball game, configure the settings to your students needs, and then copy the game URL to send to your kids.

### 3). Find helpful webpages as a student
You’re a student and have been assigned the Getting Tougher multiplication math worksheet, however, you need help. Find the Math Toolkit and navigate to the multiplication math shortcuts to find helpful information. Once you’re done, go back to the Getting Tougher math Worksheet.

## Wireframes & Workflows
All wireframes and workflows were created using the Balsamiq software. The PDF's were downloaded from Balsamiq to showcase the wireframes and workflows that incorporated the recommended features listed in the introduction. Feel free to try out the wireframes and test out the workflows yourself!

## User Feedback
### Task 1
* Red Button misleading for task 1
* Too many verification steps for copying URL 
### Task 2
* Same for the copy function
### Task3
* It would be nice if she didn’t have to select topics again. Appears that the design may be too redundant when it comes to navigating pages.
* Should be intuitive for shortcuts to go to multiplication. Specifically, if she clicks on the math toolkit button while working on a multiplication worksheet, it should instinctively direct the user to the multiplication help pages.

## Reflections
To initially test the wireframe/wireflow and address any issues that may have come up during the actual pilot test, I did a test run and used my mother-in-law as a test subject. And I'm so happy I did. My initial instructions were rough and the tasks definitely needed refinement. After the conclusion of the test run with my mother-in-law, I used my notes and addressed all the pain points to make the actual test smooth and seamless.

One issue I must highlight is that I did not understand Balsamiq's limitations as a software. Specifically, I assumed that after crafter wireframes, and creating links between other wireframe pages, that it would have a natively built workflow option to show the process of the features (much like Adobe XD and other high fidelity softwares). Unfortunately, my assumption was wrong after spending a lot of research time in Balsamiq's forums to find answers to my questions. This subsequently led me to not providing a full fledged workflow. The alternative solution I came up with was producing two different interactive PDF's: one with markups and one without. I am hoping the one with markups can provide additional information and highlight the features proposed to give the reviewer a clear idea of the workflow as an alternative to the traditional style of presenting one. In the future, I will use hand drawn sketches to incorporate a workflow and then transfer it into a wireframe prototype. Needless to say, I learned the lesson the hard way.
