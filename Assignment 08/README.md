# Improving Open-source Learning Platforms for Teachers
### by Garrett Romero

## Introduction
Given the current conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, I noticed a strong trend in news reports and Twitter posts of how teachers and students alike were struggling with the new normal of online learning. More importantly, I know first-hand how online learning tools can come at a cost that is well beyond the budget of a teacher's salary. Using my Aunt Janet as inspiration, who has been a world class teacher for over 30 years, I set out on a UX journey to help improve an open-source online learning tool that could positively impact a learning environment.

## Design Statement
#### *How can I create a positive user experience for online and open-source learning platforms that teachers can effectively use for teaching their students during the COVID-19 pandemic?* 
The parameters of the research study required identifying a digital platform that was frequently used by middle-aged women, either web or app related, and improving the overall usability and user experience for the user. Given the requirements of the study, I identified open-source learning platforms used by teachers as an area for improvement. After an initial landscape analysis of open-source math platforms, it was apparent that these sites were antiquated in design and hard to navigate. With this in mind, I selected the mathisfun.com website as the platform as my case study. Using this platform as the basis for my UX research and design, my goal was to improve efficiency, create novel features, and explore other possibilities that would improve the sites  user experience while ultimately assisting a teacher facilitating math lessons through online learning.

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
The first phase of implementing the UX research study was to conduct a competitor analysis between two different websites. Through the findings from the landscape analysis, I selected the mathantics.com and mathisfun.com open-source websites and performed a heuristic analysis on each site. Using Jakob Nielsen's [10 Usability Heuristic's](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/), I was able to identify various violations. More importantly, I used a severity scale of 0-3 to rank the significance and importance of each violation. 

While I conducted a thorough heuristic analysis of both websites, the mathisfun.com platform seemed the most flexible in terms of adding in design improvements and new features. Through the analysis, the findings determined that the most severe violations were demonstrated by User control and freedom, Match between system and the real world, and Recognition rather than recall.

## Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
After conducting the heuristic evaluation, it was important to understand the painpoints and design issues from the user perspective as well. Usability Testing (UT), as a research method, helps present findings that are directly attributed through user feedback by creating design scenarios. In order to effectively design the UT, the violations from the heuristic evaluation were utilized and focused on during this phase of the study. The violations that were central throughout the UT were:

* **User Control & Freedom:** Mathisfun does provide user control and freedom, however, it is not consistent. Upon selecting the various categories displayed (algebra, geometry, etc.) on the header bar, a user does have directional functions to move forward or backwards with the content associated to it. What becomes conflictual is that there is too much user control and freedom while simultaneously lacking it.
* **Match between system and the real world:** The child pages linking to the header bar tend to deviate from this aspect. The design logos are not placed in a uniform manner, which may have the user engage visually with the content in a left-to-right or right-to-left manner.
* **Recognition rather than recall:** The area where Mathisfun does rely on recall versus recognition is when the navigational arrows to switch between content pages become non-existent. Once the arrows are removed, then the user needs to remember how to get back to previous content that was explored.
* **Consistency and standards:** The consistency issue that should be addressed is with the horizontal direction arrows that was discussed in the ‘User control and freedom’ section.

The study in many ways accomplished what the research goal was - to confirm and find pain points throughout the website. I received great feedback from my participant. I knew there was more descriptors he wanted to use that were not available and so I asked him if he cared to share any additional thoughts that were on his mind. 

* **He explicitly stated,** “I thought the site was antiquated”; “Dated and uninviting. Would only visit once. How contemporary is this going be towards modern learning when everything just looks like it is from 1993. It looks like one of the original websites. And if you're trying to tell me math is fun, there is not a single fun thing navigating your site. If this is exactly why kids hate math, it is just so stiff and there is no dimension, no depth.”


The participant also affirmed my suspicions about user control and freedom, graphics placement, recognition vs. recall, the navigation of the website being too cumbersome and difficult. What was surprising is that I was not planning on the user stumbling onto user control and freedom issues with a Scenario 2. The next scenario was going to engage with this particular violation. However, I did state that this particular violation was rampant throughout the website so it makes sense that we found related violations along the way. Another surprising aspect that I did not capture with initial heuristic evaluation was the participant unable to locate home button/logo during one of the scenarios. If I had to re-adjust my severity ranking on the heuristic evaluation, I would escalate the Consistency and Standards principle as something that needs to be addressed immediately.

## User Research: Contextual Inquiry
Based off the initial findings of the Mathisfun.com heuristic evaluation and pilot usability test, the next phase of the research focused on collecting qualitative data. Specifically, the research is based on utilizing participant observation and contextual inquiry that was focused on understanding the design issues on a deeper level through viewing and interviewing the targeted user base. The research observes and explores the tools, strategies, and pain points of teaching math to a group of elementary school children by a female, middle-aged teacher based in Los Angeles, California. The ultimate goal is to identify translatable qualitative data that can be used to help improve and/or create new features pertaining to the Mathisfun.com website.

## UX Storytelling
Storytelling in UX is one part research, one part artform. To craft a user's story, you need the data to bring actionable insights to light. However, data is not enough. You need to tell a story with that data to encompass the users your feature/product is targetting, which is a true artform in of itself. The purpose of storytelling in UX is simple: it is to drive design through emotion. When you are presenting a story to the stakeholders, they are not looking for granular insights from the research data. More often than not, they're looking for what makes a user frustrated and what they can do to solve that frustration. Ultimately, storytelling puts the stakeholders in the users shoes and removes any biases or assumptions they may have when they are crafting a feature or product for their consumers.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
Based on the data collected throughout the entire research, the next phase was to create a low-fidelity wireframe and prototype to present and test out with pilot users. The purpose of the low-fidelity wireframes is to see the system functionality and usability on the potential features being incorporated into the design. The following features were recommended based off the [User Personas and Customer Journey Maps](https://github.com/elco7985/DH250-Romero_Garrett/tree/main/Assignment%2005):

* Customization feature to tailor math worksheets
* Copy URL function to send customized/non-customized worksheets to other users
* A ‘Math Toolkit’ shortcut feature that leads a user to a help page
* A navigation button to easily go back to math worksheet
* A conceptual baseball game that incorporates group activity features and includes a Copy URL function

In order to see the viability of the proposed wireframe, a pilot tester was recruited to perform three different tasks based on the proposed features in the wireframe. The pilot test is meant to assess the design of the features and to provide user feedback for later design iterations. A simple script was drafted, highlighting the goals of the research and instructions of how to conduct the usability test.

## High-Fidelity Prototype
The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to translate the research that has been conducted on the [mathisfun.com](Https://www.mathisfun.com) website and present design concepts and improvements from the findings. More importantly, high-fidelity prototyping allows the design concept to be tested and iterate design improvements based on feedback and findings from Impression Tests and Cognitive Walkthroughs. To bring concept to reality, the Adobe XD prototyping tool was utilized to make an iterative, high-fidelity design based on the low-fidelity design initially mocked up from the Balsamiq software platform. While this high-fidelity prototype's tasks are created based on one scenario, this is not the final design outcome!

### Cognitive Walkthrough & Impression test 

The initial Impression test was conducted with my classmates but I was unable to record their interactions with the prototype. However, the feedback I received was wonderful. My classmates provided some insight as to correcting some design issues, such as adding in an 'enter' button for the pop-up windows and formatting the math problems to not confuse the user when it comes to recognition vs. recall.

The second impression test was conducted with my wife, Tanya. She also gave great feedback on the first impression test I conducted with her. Specifically, she highlighted some familiarity issues with the prototype's feature. One feature is designated for online worksheet use, which is a native feature to the website. However, it does not convey intuitiveness and leaves the user guessing as to what this feature specifically does as a function. Another aspect she highlighted was the color of the 'Copy URL' button. She did not prefer this color associated to the button, since she felt that the color of red conveyed warning and was unwelcoming. Out of the features she mentioned, I did change the color of the button for a later test but was unsure how-to re-format the design of the online worksheet feature. I felt that this would require further research and I did not have enough time to dive deeper. If I were to continue on the design of this website, this would be one of the many things I would look into.

The cognitive walkthrough conducted on both my classmates and my wife were fairly straight forward and went smoothly. After giving a summary of the Laura Q's User Persona and the task she was trying to accomplish, both classmates and my wife felt that the interaction was relevant and intuitive for Laura Q's needs and abilities to carry out the task. After completing the prototype, with modified changes to the prototype, I used my wife as a tester to go through the complete scenarios and tasks for both User Persona’s, Laura Q. and Josephine R. This second cognitive walkthrough produced similar results and it was clear that she was able to complete the tasks conveyed to her. One thing to note is I conducted a pseudo-impression test simultaneously during the second cognitive walkthrough and she did emphasize a certain level of excitement to one of the features I animated. Specifically, she was pleased with the drop-down menu options I implemented for the baseball game. One reason she was pleased is because the difficulty setting was labeled exactly the same way as the difficulty of the math worksheets for multiplication. This told me I had successfully engaged in recognition with the difficulty setting for the game.

## Conclusion & Final Reflection
In performing the research and design process from start to finish, I felt that I was able to achieve my objectives that I set forth for myself. While the heuristic evaluation was important and foundational, the usability test, participant observation and contextual inquiry were equally important towards driving design decisions. The most important takeaway from this process is that embracing a human-centered design approach requires one to be:

* A student and not a teacher
* Curious at all times
* Humble and not ego-centric

Overall, listening to the interviewers/users was key and central to the design process. One thing to note about my design process is that I believe I was overly ambitious in what I wanted to create and present in the low-fidelity and high-fidelity protypes. Specifically, I conceptually came up with a baseball game that included collaboration from the users. It was a sound idea but I lacked the technical knowhow in Balsamiq and AdobeXD, such as animation, to make my vision into reality. Another lesson I am taking away is nothing beats the power of pencil and paper. While Balsamiq is a wonderful software platform, it lacked a workflow capability, which unfortunately I was unable to demonstrate. Lastly, I would have like to test the prototypes on the targeted demographics of this research study. Due time and conflict, I was not able to use my Aunt Janet during this phase of the design process. Regardless, I do plan on showing the prototypes to her at a later time to get feedback and see what else I could have improved on the design concepts.
