### DH 250: UX+UI, by Garrett Romero

----
## Introduction
In the age of COVID-19, remote teaching has become mandatory for the educational world. Teachers are forced to utilize various technologies in order to facilitate and execute their lesson plans on a daily basis. The scope of this project focuses on how middle-age women, who are teachers in elementary school, engage with websites that provide supplemental academic resources for their lessons. The goal of this project is to help identify usability improvements for two website competitors that provide academic resources, which midddle-aged women who are teachers utilize on regular basis. In order to achieve the projects goal, a heuristic evaluation will be conducted to understand what works well and what are the pain points to create better remote learning experiences.
